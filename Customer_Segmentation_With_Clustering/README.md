# My second mini-project: Customer segmentation with clustering using k-means clustering

## Background context:

Understanding and serving customers are two of the retail industry's most important strategic marketing objectives. Knowing the customer allows businesses to be more customer-centric with improvements to metrics such as marketing efficiency, enhanced product development, increased customer satisfaction, better customer retention, price optimisation, and strategic resource allocation.

Customer segmentation allows a business to group customers based on demographics (e.g. age, gender, education, occupation, marital status, family size), geographics (e.g. country, transportation, preferred language), psychographics (e.g. lifestyle, values, personality, attitudes), behaviour (e.g. purchase history, brand loyalty, response to marketing activities), technographic (e.g. device type, browser type, original source), and needs (e.g. product features, service needs, delivery method).

The challenge in this project is to apply critical thinking and machine learning concepts to design and implement clustering models to perform customer segmentation and improve marketing efforts.
