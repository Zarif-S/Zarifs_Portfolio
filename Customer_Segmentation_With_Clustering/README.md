# My second mini-project: Customer segmentation with clustering using K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering

## Background context
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques to improve marketing strategies in the retail industry. The dataset, consisting of e-commerce transactions from customers worldwide, includes features like purchase frequency, loyalty, and order details. The goal is to group customers based on their behavior and preferences to optimize marketing efforts and resource allocation.

## Objective
The aim is to develop a clustering model to segment customers and guide targeted marketing. The project involves exploring and preprocessing data, applying feature engineering, and using machine learning to identify valuable customer segments based on metrics like frequency, recency, and customer lifetime value (CLV).

## What It Demonstrates
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Analyze complex data and propose solutions.
- Apply clustering techniques for customer segmentation.
- Use feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to improve model performance and business insights.
