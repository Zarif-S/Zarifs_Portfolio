# My first mini-project: Detecting the anomalous activity of a shipâ€™s engine! - Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (No Ground Truth)

## Background context:

A poorly maintained ship engine in the supply chain industry can lead to inefficiencies, increased fuel consumption, higher risks of malfunctions, and potential safety hazards. 

The challenge in this project is to apply critical thinking and ML concepts to design and implement a robust anomaly detection model.
