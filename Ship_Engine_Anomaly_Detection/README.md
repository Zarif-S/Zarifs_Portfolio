# My first mini-project: Detecting the anomalous activity of a shipâ€™s engine! - Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (No Ground Truth)

# Background Context
This project involves detecting anomalous activity in a ship's engine, which can lead to inefficiencies, safety risks, and downtime in the supply chain. The dataset includes six key features (e.g., engine rpm, lubrication oil pressure, fuel pressure) that are monitored to assess engine performance. Anomalies make up about 1% to 5% of the data, and detecting them can help prevent costly malfunctions and improve operational efficiency.

# Objective
The aim is to build an anomaly detection system using machine learning and statistical methods to identify potential engine issues. The project focuses on selecting the best techniques for anomaly detection, setting thresholds for abnormal observations, and predicting when maintenance is required.

# What It Demonstrates
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Solve complex problems through data analysis and strategic solutions.
- Identify patterns and anomalies, showcasing advanced statistical thinking.
- Apply appropriate machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and model improvement.
- Design effective unsupervised learning solutions for maintaining ship engine functionality.
